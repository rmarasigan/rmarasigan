### Hi there, I'm @rmarasigan ðŸ‘‹:smile:

A Software Developer from Philippines. For Web Development, I have a background in both back-end and in front-end. I design and build user interfaces. I personally prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter. Code things from scratch and bringing ideas to life in the browser. Iâ€™m currently taking an Amazon Web Service Certified Cloud Practitioner Course.
